# C - Hash tables
## Synopsis
- A hash table is a randomized data structure that supports the INSERT, DELETE, and FIND operations in expected O(1) time. The core idea behind hash tables is to use a hash function that maps a large keyspace to a smaller domain of array indices, and then use constant-time array operations to store and retrieve the data.

# Hash Table Implementation
## Description
This repository contains a basic implementation of a Hash Table data structure in [programming language of your choice]. A hash table is a data structure that provides fast access to key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to convert keys into indices in an array, allowing for constant-time (O(1)) average case lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.

Insertion: Add key-value pairs to the hash table.
Lookup: Retrieve the value associated with a given key.
Deletion: Remove key-value pairs from the hash table.
Collision Handling: Handle collisions using a suitable collision resolution technique (e.g., chaining, open addressing).

## Compilation 
g++ -o hash_table main.cpp

## Implementation Details
The hash table is implemented using a [brief explanation of your chosen implementation approach, e.g., an array-based approach with chaining]. It uses a [mention the hash function used] hash function to compute indices for keys.

[You can add more details here, such as information about how you handle resizing, load factors, or other design considerations.]
